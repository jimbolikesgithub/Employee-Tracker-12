# Employee-Tracker-12

--- In this challenge, we were tasked to create tables to keep track of our employees, their
roles, and their respective departments. Using MySql in conjunction with inquirer prompts, our
goal was to allow the user to view the tables created in our database, as well as edit it. It
was one of the more enjoyable challenges where I felt I could learn a lot --- and learn I did.
Very excited for the next challenge wherein we'll find an easier way of using MySql! ---
